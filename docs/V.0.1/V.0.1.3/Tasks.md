# Tasks

## Preprocessing
- [X] Compute embeddings for tweets.
- [X] Extend labeled tweets interface with embeddings.
- [ ] Fetch topics from Cortazar DB.

## Embedding's Correlations
- [X] Create 5 embeddingh using PCA models: 12, 24, 48, 96 & 512.
- [X] Linear regression on each embedding's feature.
- [ ] Output top tweet examples for each feature.
- [ ] Based on examples name the features for the 12 dimensions model.

## Cluster Analysis
- [ ] Reuse embeddings models to find 6, 12 & clusters.
- [ ] Correlate clusters with engagement and name each cluster.
- [ ] Create additional 6 dimmension model and use it to cluster tweet with engagement metrics.
- [ ] Third cluster analysis merging embedded tweets & features.
- [ ] Analyze insights and document results.

## Topic Classifications
- [ ] Label tweets by topics.
- [ ] Compute averages by topics.
- [ ] Correlate embeddings to topics.
- [ ] Prepare insights for feature engineering and strategy evalutation.
