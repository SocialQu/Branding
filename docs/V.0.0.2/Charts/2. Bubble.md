# 2. Engagement Bubbles

## Passing Criteria
- [ ] Last week tweets are plotted in 2 dimensions.
- [ ] The size of the tweet is representative of its engagement.
- [ ] Tweets are colored based on its topic.
- [ ] On a tooltip, the topic label and tweet content is displayed.


## Data Model
```
point:{
    x:number
    y:number
}

bubbles: {
    tweet: string
    topic: string 
    color: string
    coordinates: Point
    engagements: number
}[]
```

## Data Requirements
- [ ] Tweets are represented as word embeddings.
- [ ] A PCA map is used to reduce dimensionality.
- [ ] Topics are fetched and assigned to colors.
- [ ] Tweet metrics are reused from KPIs.

## Implementation
1. [ ] Tweet data and metrics is reused form initial fetch.
2. [ ] Text is transformed into sentence embeddings.
3. [ ] Topics are fetched and fed as input.
4. [ ] The closest topic for each tweet is selected.
5. [ ] The tweet object is assembled and stored.


## Next Steps
* [ ] Personalized and/or dynamic PCA datasets?
* [ ] Add labels to explain the color topics.
* [ ] The number of tweets is extended and controlled by a side bar.
* [ ] Impressions can also represent a tweet's size.
