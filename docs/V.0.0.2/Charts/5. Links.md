# 5. Link Clicks Correlations

## Passing Criteria
- [ ] Spider chart for each different with 4 dimensions:
    - [ ] Tweets
    - [ ] Engagements
    - [ ] Impressions
    - [ ] Clicks

- [ ] Table of influence in clicks.
    - [ ] By Link
    - [ ] By times shared.
    - [ ] By Tweet Length.
    - [ ] Number of emojis.
    - [ ] Position of the link.
    - [ ] Time of the day.
    - [ ] Day of the week.

- [ ] The table of influence also contains the ideal value.


## Data Model
```
correlations:{
    link: number
    frequency: number
    lenght: number
    emojis: number
    position: number
    time: number
    weekday: number
}

links:{
    tweets: number
    engagements: number
    impressions: number
    clicks: number
}[]
```

## Data Requirements
- [ ] An NPM package to compute quadratic correlation and its coefficient.
- [ ] A second NPM package to find the maximum value of the equation.
- [ ] A domain for each correlation to find the maximum value.


## Implementation
- [ ] Filter out links from tweets.
- [ ] Get original URL of the link.
- [ ] Aggregate stats by tweet.
- [ ] Compute correlation coefficient. 
- [ ] Get the maximum or ideal value for each correlation.
- [ ] Store values on DB.


## Next Steps
- [ ] Dimensions (e.g. engagements) can be hidden.
- [ ] Table of influence compares efficiency in engagement of likes against tweets.
