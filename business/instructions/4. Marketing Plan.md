# IV. Marketing Plan 

This section provides details on your industry, the competitive landscape, your target market and how you will market your business to those customers. 

## 1. Market research

There are two kinds of research: primary and secondary. Primary market research is information you gather yourself. This could include going online or driving around town to identify competitors; interviewing or surveying people who fit the profile of your target customers; or doing traffic counts at a retail location you’re considering. 

Secondary market research is information from sources such as trade organizations and journals, magazines and newspapers, Census data and demographic profiles. You can find this information online, at libraries, from chambers of commerce, from vendors who sell to your industry or from government agencies. 

This section of your plan should explain:

* The total size of your industry 
* Trends in the industry – is it growing or shrinking? 
* The total size of your target market, and what share is realistic for you to obtain
* Trends in the target market – is it growing or shrinking? How are customer needs or preferences changing? 

## 2. Barriers to entry 

What barriers to entry does your startup face, and how do you plan to overcome them? Barriers to entry might include:

* High startup costs
* High production costs
* High marketing costs
* Brand recognition challenges
* Finding qualified employees
* Need for specialized technology or patents
* Tariffs and quotas 
* Unionization in your industry

## 3. Threats and opportunities 

Once your business surmounts the barriers to entry you mentioned, what additional threats might it face? Explain how the following could affect your startup:

* Changes in government regulations
* Changes in technology
* Changes in the economy
* Changes in your industry


## 4. Product/service features and benefits 

Describe all of your products or services, being sure to focus on the customer’s point of view. For each product or service:

* Describe the most important features. What is special about it? 
* Describe the most important benefits. What does it do for the customer? 

In this section, explain any after-sale services you plan to provide, such as:

* Product delivery
* Warranty/guarantee
* Service contracts
* Ongoing support
* Training
* Refund policy

## 5. Target customer

Describe your target customer. (This is also known as the ideal customer or buyer persona.) 

You may have more than one target customer group. For instance, if you sell a product to consumers through distributors, such as retailers, you have at least two kinds of target customers: the distributors (businesses) and the end users (consumers).  

Identify your target customer groups, and create a demographic profile for each group that includes:

For consumers:
* Age
* Gender
* Location
* Income
* Occupation
* Education level

For businesses:
* Industry
* Location
* Size
* Stage in business (startup, growing, mature)
* Annual sales

## 6. Key competitors 

One of the biggest mistakes you can make in a business plan is to claim you have “no competition.” Every business has competitors. Your plan must show that you’ve identified yours and understand how to differentiate your business. This section should: 

List key companies that compete with you (including names and locations), products that compete with yours and/or services that compete with yours. Do they compete across the board, or just for specific products, for certain customers or in certain geographic areas? 
Also include indirect competitors. For instance, if you’re opening a restaurant that relies on consumers’ discretionary spending, then bars and nightclubs are indirect competitors. 

Use the Competitor Data Collection Plan on the next page to brainstorm ways you can collect information about competitors in each category.
