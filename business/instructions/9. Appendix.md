# IX. Appendices 

Donâ€™t slow your readers down by cluttering your business plan with supporting documents, such as contracts or licenses. Instead, put these documents in the Appendices, and refer to them in the body of the plan so readers can find them if needed. 

Below are some elements many business owners include in their Appendices. 

1. Agreements (Leases, contracts, purchase orders, letters of intent, etc.)
2. Intellectual property (trademarks, licenses, patents, etc.)
3. Resumes of owners/key employees
4. Advertising/marketing materials
5. Public relations/publicity 
6. Blueprints/plans
7. List of equipment 
8. Market research studies
9. List of assets that can be used as collateral

You can also include any other materials that will give readers a fuller picture of your business or support the projections and assumptions you make in your plan. For instance, you might want to include photos of your proposed location, illustrations or photos of a product you are patenting, or charts showing the projected growth of your market. 

After reviewing the Appendices, the reader should feel satisfied that the assumptions throughout the plan are backed up by documentation and evidence.
