### Analytics

As of 2020, there are 42 unicorns in the Analytics space. Around 80% of companies are from America, and non from LatinAmerica.

Startups can be classified in three dimensions:

1. By industry (healthcare, finance, advertisment).
2. By department (revenue, product, compliance).
3. By function (storage, AI, streaming).

Unicorns are usually leaders in 1 or 2 dimensions. This allows them to have a sufficiently big market to attract investors.

On average unicorns were found 8 to years ago and there are 3 interesting opportunitier for SocialQ in this space:

1. No analytics startup is focues on NLP. There are some in focused on AI, with possibly feauters for text and other unstructured data both none specialized.
2. None is focusing on the content creators economy. The closest it gets is in merketing and advertisement.
3. There is an opportunity for a fourth dimension of startups: by platform. Examples of this would be for email, social media, web, and infrastructure. By focusing on Twitter we could be find lesser competition (with little incentives to compete for unicorns).
