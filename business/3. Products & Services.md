## 1. The Problem we Solve

When creating content is not easy to know what works for your brand, creates engagement, leads, drives traffic and grow sales. 

Most analytics tools provides stats similar to the Tweeter native ones, this is usually offered as a complement of another feature like tweeter scheduling. 

The problem is that this stats while helpful to measure the performance of a Twitter account, provide little insights as what type of content to focus on.

While many tools follow a similar approach to Google Analytics or other web related platforms. Twitter enables brands to fully understand who is their target market and work with them to provide more value for their customers.
