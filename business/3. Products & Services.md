## 1. The Problem we Solve

When creating content is not easy to know what works for your brand, creates engagement, leads, drives traffic and grows sales. 

Most analytics tools provides the stats similar to Tweeter's native stats, this is usually offered as a complement of another feature like tweet scheduling. The problem is that this stats while helpful to measure the performance of a Twitter account, provide little insights as what type of content to write.

While many tools follow a similar approach to Google Analytics or other web related platforms. Twitter enables brands to fully understand who is their target market and work to provide more value to them.
