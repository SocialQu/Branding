## Executive Summary

### Product
Wooden Grain Toys manufactures high-quality toys for children aged 3-10. All toys are made from solid hardwoods including maple, beech, birch, cherry, and oak. The toys are built to be long lasting with sufficient moving parts to engage each child’s interest, but not limit his or her imagination. 

### Customers
The target audience for Wooden Grain Toys is adults, specifically parents and grandparents who wish to give their children or grandchildren the opportunity to play with a toy that is not only durable and aesthetically pleasing, but also foster the child’s creativity.

## Market Research

### Industry
Built-Rite Toys will be a part of the toy manufacturing industry. Currently, wooden toys are considered a niche market, comprised of different sized companies. The largest companies, such as Plastique Toys and Metal Happy Toys, have large inventories of products that are offered internationally. The smallest companies sell locally either in shops, at craft fairs, or online.

This industry is currently suffering from the economic recession as consumers are spending less on non-essentials. However, industry revenues increased by $1.2 million in the 2nd quarter of 2012. This means there is a potential for growth as the economy recovers.

### Detailed Description of Customers
The two groups that the company plans to market to are parents (age 18-30) of young children and grandparents (age 60-75) of young children with an income range of $35,000 - $80,000 a year. Our target customers are interested in giving durable, well-made toys to their children and grandchildren to help foster creativity. They value quality and they research the products they buy. Our target customers are willing to spend more money on products that are of higher quality and last longer.

### Company Advantages

* Basic, practical designs.
* Safe, non-toxic paints, parts, and accessories.

* Quick, 48-hour delivery since our goal is to keep at least 50 units of each toy in stock.

### Regulations

Specifically, Code of Federal Regulations in Title 42, Parts 1234 and 9876.50, 51, 52 and 89 C.F.R. 5555.18(a)(9); Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008; Lead-Free Toys Act; and Title 99.9 of the Code of Oregon.
