## Mission

SocialQ aims to help brands understand what content resonates with their audiences.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence tweets can be classified by topic. 
Measuring the average engagement will provide useful hints to what type of content is useful and can lead to growth and sales.
Additionally, the same technology can be applied to understand what type of audience is your follower base comprised and to which niches they belong. 
Aggregating that type of previously unstructured data provides valuable knowledge to think strategically about your brand and business.
