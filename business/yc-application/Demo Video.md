Hi I'm Santiago founder of SocialQ

I want to explain you how to use AI to increase your Twitter engagement.

I will use my own Twitter account as an example.

The first step is to understand what you are tweeting about.

SocialQ classifies your tweets by topic to show which are the most common ones and what type of engagement and impressions are they generating.

Most of my tweets are about Javacript, and a few about product and VCs. 

The same can be done for your audience, using your followers bios you can learn to what niche are they most likely to be part of. 

Of my last 20 followers 4 have come from product. Knowing your audience answers 2 questions for you:

1. Am I attracting the right audience?
2. Am I creating the right content for my audience?

Personally, I can improve for the second topic.
As I could ocassionaly tweet more humorously.

The second step is to go in more depth about where your engagement is comming from. This is the engagement map:
every dot is a tweet, the larger the dot the larger the engagement it got. Also, the closer 2 dots are together the more closer its meaning is.

Exploring the map, I discovered 5 types of tweets:
1. The first on the top left are questions, this produce by far the most engagement.
2. A little below, are tweets that encourage replies. Some of the got results.
3. At the center lie the tweets about personal new, I was postively surprised to learn that my audience cares about my day to day.
4. There is a 4th cluster somewhat dispersed in the map, is what I call informational tweets, and I got the least engagement for them.
5. Finally, to the right are tweets about my product. This can improve but I'm satisfied that they at least create some engagement.

I will consider these when tweeting during the next days. I will also be attentive of new formats to tweet as there is plenty of blank space in the map that I could explore.


The last part uses word clouds, to show precicely what type of words create the most engagement. This section is under active development, but so far I already learned to not tweet anymore about strategy. I also got some recommnedations as to what kind of topics to tweet more and which ones to reduce.

I hope you enjoyed the presentation, if you are interested in having your own dashboard send me a DM to join the beta program.
