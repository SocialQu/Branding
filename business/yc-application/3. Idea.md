13. Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
I picked the idea after launching my first product. I recognized that without a network or audience I had little chance of succeding no matter how cool the product would be. This was reinforced by my experience as a writer. So I decided to build a product that helped me grow a network or audience.

Yes, I have experience in NLP through the CS224 YouTube Stanford Lectures, more than 2 years of projects applying it and also writing about it. Additionally, I've been studying Machine Learning for the last 10 years.

I'm not sure that people wan this, but creating content is one of the few marketing alternives that small players can compete against large corporations. My bet is to create a product to leverage this market inefficiency and ride the wave of growing industry.


14. What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
What I'm doing is similar to how Amplitude transformed how web products were developed. We are offering the possibility to content creators (a growing industry) to measure results, test hypothesis, and make data driven decisions. 

Alternatives include:
Online courses teachnig people how to create good content for Twitter.
Digital marketing agencies and freelancers offering their services to increase engagement.
Social media listeners apps that incorporate default Twitter metrics and sentiment analysis.
Tools to schedule content.

Non of this options offer a feedback iterative cycle to consistently improve content.

15. Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
There are established players like HubSpot, Buffer and Sprout Social in social management space.
If an established or innovative CRM wants to create a smart, tight integration with Twitter they might have a stronger, wider value proposition than us.
An indirect but intersting competitor to watch is Grammarly which might evolve and create a product to solve a similar problem than us.

I fear most being subject to Twitter's policies which might pose a danger to operations and restrictions to product development.


16. What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
I've writing online for 2 years so I understand how frustrating it is to invest 40+ hours in a good piece content only to rely on external distribution mechanisms. I also feel the pain of fellow founders to work heavily on a product and have no real place to iteratively promote it, and be labeled or banned for self-promotion by many platforms.  

17. How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
During this next 4 months I'm focused on finding the 100 people that love our product, and improving the AI technology.

After that I have some ideas including:
* Develop "enterprise dashboards" for internet brands to grow their brand leveraging the network of their employees. A similar model could be applied to niche communities.
* Premium charts, analysis or even what I called an engagement text editor that highlights in real time improvements that could be made to the text. There is an interesting possibily around these idea: I could charge by number of followers (capturing the value that product brings and driving cost of acquisition down)
* I could create a marketplace, where data scientists could sell their analysis or freelancers could offer their measurable track record.
* I could offer the technology to grow engagement on online communities in Discord or Slack.
* Slightly off the shelf, but with a solid network I could create a crypto currency that creates a digital closed economy rewarding cross-promotion.

Ultimately the goal is to create a SaaS business that grows the number of seats (by employee for B2B) and the cost per seat (by the number of followers).

Some back of the envelope numbers:
* Twitter has 200 Mio monetizable users. At $10 USD for the top 1% of creators that's 20 Mio MRR.
* The global advertising market size is worth 600+ Billion, while the content creation space is a mere 10+ Billion. While it is hard to imagine  


18. How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
I have around 1,500 followers on Twitter, SEO experience from 2 years of blogging and a solid prescence on niche communities like Indie Hackers. But to get the first 100 users I will use cold reach by email and DM. I'm currently evaluating 20 different potential markets and following the 24 steps of the disciplined entrepreneur, after finding the optimal market to get started I will specialize the product to provide the most value.

19. If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder.
I will go as a solo-founder leaving up to 30% for advisors and early employees to compensate any lack of skills of time I have during the early stages of the startup.

20. Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.


21. Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
I write the code, I have worked in startups for the last 4 years. I have experienced 10x growth and the code is currently open sourced at: .

22. Is there anything else we should know about your company?
Yes, despite being located in LatinAmerica I aim to go after the US market. I consider our enterprise as a moonshot, if I fail to build a product that maximizes engagement for our users, I'll apply the NLP technology to translate proven business models for the Spanish language.
