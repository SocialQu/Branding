23. If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
I'm passively pursing other interesting ideas:
* A Bot to teach Spanish using GPT-3. I already have a partner (she has a small business to connect students with native speakers), and access to GPT-3 we are still early on the prototyping of the technology and defining the business model.
* An online course to teach Astrology, this is more like a familar matter but interesting ideas could be brought in from the startup community to a lucrative and widespread industry.
* Fractional CTO as a Service, I would offer 10 hours of consulting to guide the tech strategy, design new features, push and review key pieces of code, and recruit for pre-seed companies. My vision is to turn this business in 5 years into an incubator connecting future entrepreneurs with mexican engineering talent.

Other ideas I've paused:
* Personalized newsletters based on Cortazar.ml technology.
* Interactive courses / NLP academy as shown in Borgez.ml
* Video-conference automatic summarization as in ()

Ideas I'm developing:
* A peer to peer platform to outsource personal communication to bots. Basically, you train 5+ different bots based on your interests/goals, and these bots chat with each other finding potential areas for collaboration. The bots are retrained based on your online prescence, either blogs, Twitter, emails or what you feel confortable sharing.

24. Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
After consulting in a Computer Vision startup, I'm more convinced than ever that NLP is technology that will boost productivity for the next decade. I parallel it to Mobile Development in the 2000s, the Internet on the 90's or crypto more recently. My take is that arguably AI, is useful enough to be a significant part of our lives, however Computer Vision is to expensive to deploy compared to text based technology. Possibly, as a result of NLP we will change how we communicate, being more error tolerant and confortable with the fact that 80+% of our communication will be carried by bots in our name.

25. What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?
Getting in, has been dream since I dropped out 10 years ago. I'm not backing down.
