Hi YC,
My name is Santiago
and I'm solving distribution for creators.

Distribution is a repetitive process
that creates network effocts.

So, I will find the most talented creators
distribute their work
and build a great product during the process

My vision is inspired in the bees
that use the nectar of flowers to create honey
and pollinate them during the process.

And just as a flowers only focused on attracting the bee, 
I believe a creator should not care about distribution.

I hope you enjoy my application,
understand the problem
and believe in my vision.

See you soon!
