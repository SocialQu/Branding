7. How far along are you?
Following last Build Sprint, I have an MVP that will enable me to test the following hypothesis:
* Does engagement increases using analytical data and insights?
* Are content creators willing to adopt new tools during their creative proccess?

I have also heavily invested in the GTM strategy and have been created content to promote the product.


8. How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
8 months full-time.
I started working on the idea last October and launched V1 on January this year.
For 2 months I growht the product, and then I focused on developing the AI/NLP technology until May. 

After taking a consulting gig for 3 months, I am now full time again on the project.


9. How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they? If you're building hardware, how many units have you shipped?

10. Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?
As a preparation for the product, 

11. If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
Yes, I'm applying with the same idea as last batch. The main change lies in the technology (NLP).
Before metrics used hashtags or word clouds to visualize information, the problem was the product did not 
offer a radically better value proposition to the default Twitter Analytics.

12. If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.
As an engineer I've participated in Techstars and Acceleprise. Never as a founder, and not with this idea.
