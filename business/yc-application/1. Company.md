SocialQ uses AI to transform text data into numerical values.
This allows to graph unstructured data as if it was numerical like in finance and other analytics heavy industries.
Our first feature classifies tweets across 80 topics using a proprietary database.

Currently, internet brands that use Twitter to grow awareness of their products
have difficulty predicting what content will generate engagement.
By showing them what type of content is working for them, they will be able to focus 
to save time and improve their results. 
It will be the difference between tweeting randomly, and creating content based on data and a framework.

In the future I expect the technology can be translated to journalism, blogging, 
online communities (Slack & Discord),text-rich social media (LinkedIn, Instagram photo descriptions) 
& headlines analysis.

6. Please enter the url of a 1 minute unlisted (not private) YouTube video introducing the founder(s). This video is an important part of the application. (Follow the Video Guidelines.)
