# How to find a Twitter voice for your Product

As I work on getting traction for [Twitter Analytics at your Inbox](https://santiagoq.gumroad.com/l/twitter-analytics) I found that I needed to develop a content strategy that creates inbound leads for my product.

So I started looking at other [founders that I admire](https://twitter.com/agazdecki) and are getting good traction to learn what is it that they are doing right to consistenly create good engagement.

In this post, I will share the 10 steps that I used to define the strategy for my product. For each I include concrete examples so you can also start thinking about yours.


1. Choose a message that is relevant to your product.
For me it will be growing an audience. Interestingly, it's because I looked at [this post]() about launching in Product Hunt and I was amazed about how many different opiniones audience building brings. Plus, people looking to receive their Twitter Analytics periodically are most likely trying to build an audience.


2. Make your message bigger than your product.
Now, I'm not choosing Twitter, or even content creation as a message. It would be boring! 
And since my product plays only a small role in the audience building space I can start creating awareness by delivering an interesting message to people that might not be ready to use my product yet.
My goal is that a person that first reads my tweets, asks themselves: Santiago writes cool content, I wonder what product does he offers? 


3. Find a funny take to support your message.
We like to be entertained, so don't be so serious and try to make people smile.
It works the best, if you are consistent about what you make fun, to let people know what to expect. 
After some deliveration, I chose first-time founders. Particularily, those that do not focus on marketing and distribution enough. 


4. Promote succesful people that capture your product's values.
This serves two outcomes: create engaging content that reinforces your content and building strategical relationships with influencers in your niche. I recommend you take a look at the concept of the [Dream 100]() to learn who are the people you may want to promote. An example for me is [Arvid Kahl](https://twitter.com/arvidkahl) that wrote a book about building an audience.


5. Provide valuable advice for the problem you solve.
The obvious, you will need to become a domain expert. I plan to do this via reading, I will assign daily time to this task and focus on sharing what I learn to technically oriented founders. As I scale, I will generalize my message to encompass other people that with whom I do not necesarily share a background. 


6. Advice on what not to do it's just as valuable.
Might be intutive, but is better to be concious about this. We learn as much from good examples as from bad examples. This step works great in conjunction with step 3 and might also possibly include autobiographical references. By admiting your mistakes is easier for people to relate to you. For me it will be easy, as I'm still a first-time founder and most of my income today comes from consulting not my business.


7. Convey one idea per tweet.
It is tempting to deliver a lot of value but Twitter rewards short content so when writing a Tweet focus on delivering a single message. 


8. Share media congruent with you message deliver.
Twitter is a text based social network. But is okay to ocasionally share images that suppoort the values you promote. One example for me would be screenshots of other succesful products that achieved impressing growth numbers by building an audience.


9. Debunk myths around your niche.
Is always engaging to look at unpopular opinions. Stir controversy by debunking common wisdom related to the problem you solve. Examples for me are that building an audience only brings benefit on the long term, or that it involves a lot of grind.


10. Be inspirational when you promote your product.
Your product is not only a solution, it should inspire a lifestyle. So be sure to share that vision when you (very ocasionally) promote your product. More than promotion, is a reminder of the values that you stand for. [My newsletter](https://santiagoq.gumroad.com/l/twitter-analytics) believes that an audience is the shortest path to living a creative, fulfiling life.
