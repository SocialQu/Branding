    * A signifacnt change (or event) is the best place to start a story.

    * The violation of expectations that trigger a search for an explanation.
    * Knowledge or possession of information by someone else.

* Grabbing attention
    * To make vivid scenes list 3 specific qualities of an object.
        * *A dark blue carpet*
        * *An orange striped pencil*
    * Evoke the quality you want to communicate
        * Don't say it was delightful, make the reader say delightful!
    * We are wired to be fascinated by others
        * We get a lot of information from human faces.
        * Errors about what others are thinking are a major cause of drama & comedy. 
        * To get density for a scene or character, ask: What does A think B is thinking about A?
    * Meaningfulness brings attention, not "standing out".
    * Small details to prelude importance:
        * Two cups of water before sighting the T-Rex for the first time.

    * Small metaphors create gorgeous scences.
    * A metaphor can force us to imagine a scene.

    * Metaphors can be used to make a coneptual point, not only visuals.
        * A door without a lock or key.

    * Also used for romantic scences.
        * *She could feel herself through him, the way her body existed only where he touched her. The rest was smoke*
