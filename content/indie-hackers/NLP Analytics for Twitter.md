# NLP Analytics for Twitter

I've been blogging for the last two years.
And it has always puzzled me what creates good copywrite.

I'm a very analytic person, I love looking at stats, dashboards and data to guide my decisions.
But as a writer I've found that there is little information I can use to improve my writing.


I've practicing AI & NLP for the last 10 years and it was amusing to me that despite 
recent advances in the field, we were still limited to traditional metrics like replies and retweets
that said nothing about the type of content that caused those engagements.

So I dustet out my skills, took some time off, and learned basic content creation strategies. 
Now I have an MVP to show with only 3, but very useful metrics.


## Content and Audience Analysis


## Engagement Map


## Topic Suggestions

I have many more ideas to follow this 3 metrics, but my goal at the moment is to hear your thoughts and find my beach head market. So please, if you read so far, take 3 minutes to share your thoughts and let me know if you would be interested in beta testing this product. You can also connect with via Twitter.

Best,
