# NLP Analytics for Twitter

For the last two years, I've been blogging about tech, startups & AI.
Some stories have made the front cover of Medium others had barely achieved 20+ views.

It has always puzzled me what creates good copywrite.
Although correlated, the success of a story is largely independent to the hours invested in writing or distribution.

In blogging, success largely depends on two factors: SEO & reader engagement.
However, both are hard to predict,

Last year, I started twitting.
The short and casual nature of content cautivated.

But the issue persisted: what creates a good Tweet?

I'm a very analytic person, and I love looking at stats, dashboards and data to guide my decisions.
But as a writer I've found that there is little information that I can use to improve my writing.
Href, produces some clues but is not enough
And I've never encountered a platform to A/B test headlines.
So I set on goal to create a dashboard that goes further that the traditional engagement metrics.


### Topic Classification

The first feature you'll see are your tweets classified by topics. 
In a single charts you can see what you are tweeting about, 
and what type of engagement is creating.

Interestingly, the same can be done with your follower's bios.
By knowing who your audience is you can adapt your message.
I was impressed by how many recent followers I have interested in Product Management.
I've also never thought of tweeting with humor, is a vertical I might explore.
On the other side, I might be tweeting too much about Javascript :joy:
