# How to find a Twitter voice for your Product

As I work on getting traction for [Twitter Analytics at your Inbox](https://santiagoq.gumroad.com/l/twitter-analytics) I found that I needed to develop a content strategy that creates inbound leads for my product.

So I started looking at other [founders that I admire](https://twitter.com/agazdecki) and are getting good traction to learn what is it that they are doing right to consistenly create good engagement.

In this post, I will share the 10 steps that I used to define the strategy for my product. For each I include concrete examples so you can also start thinking about yours.

1. Choose a message that is relevant to your product.
For me it will be growing an audience. Interestingly, it's because I looked at this post about launching in Product Hunt and I was amazed about how many different opiniones audience building brings. Plus, people looking to receive their Twitter Analytics periodically are most likely trying to build an audience.

2. Make your message bigger than your product.


3. Find a funny take to support your message.


4. Promote succesful people that capture your product's values.


5. Provide valuable advice for the problem you solve.


6. Advice on what not to do it's just as valuable.


7. Convey one idea per tweet.


8. Share media congruent with you message deliver.


9. Debunk myths around your niche.


10. Be inspirational when you promote your produt.
