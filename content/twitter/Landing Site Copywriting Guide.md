10 tips to write your own landing site copy. 

A thread based on the [amazing guide](https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/landing-pages) by [@Julian](https://twitter.com/Julian)


## 1. Define the goal. 
*A landing site is your business's first impression.*

What impression do you want to give?

In my case, I want the visitor to think: what an innovative solution for such a common problem. I should try it


## 2. Choose what type of landing site it is.
*Is it a homepage, persona landing page, or a product page?*

For me, it is a product page. I may focus the copy on the features and the product's screenshots


## 3. Think about the visitor

To explain my product, I will follow this template:

* What is the product?
* Who is it for?
* What it offers?
* An overview of the features.
* What makes it special?
* How can you get started?
* FAQ section


## 4. Tell a story with your CTAs

Alternate different types to maximize conversion.

* Informational CTA: prepare your offer.
* Redirect: to your other products.
* Main CTA: be providential.
* Alternative CTA: to give additional information.
* Contact CTA.


## 5. Content verticals

Answer these 3 questions to pitch your product.

* How will you increase desire?
* How are you making it easy for the visitor?
* How will you avoid confusion? 

I suggest having at least 3 answers for each question and include all of them in your copy.



## 6. Identify the top-selling points

Imagine yourself pitching to your ideal buyer.

What arguments would you use to persuade them? 

* Reinforce the importance of the problem you solve.
* Compare your product against other solutions.
* Share what you love about the product.
