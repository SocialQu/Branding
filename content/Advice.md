# Help: My 2.5K business just got boring!

Back in November, we had the successful launch of an online course to teach astrology for personal development.  We had almost 100 paying users and generated around 2.5K. A decent success!

During the rest of that month and December, we were focused on finishing the course and making sure we were providing a positive experience to our first users (fortunately, they are really happy).

When I was building the course, I was busy building the platform: it has a News Feed, a forum for questions (solved weekly during a Zoom), 4 types of lessons (video, readings, quizzes, and open questions), and an astrological chart that involved complex SVG and astronomical calculations. It was fun!

Now I do not have much to do as a technical founder. We are happy with the product and see the potential to get more than 1,000 students during the course next year. So some of the activities I've been performing this week are: plan an SEO strategy, set up Facebook ads and help create content, analyze user engagement to create newsletters and avoid churn, and record a paid podcast to extend the course into a paid community in the future.

Not only are those tasks non-time consuming, but they do not involve engineering whatsoever. So as I think about it I have a couple of alternatives:

1. Start preparing the next astrology-related product.
2. Live the 10-hour workweek and hope we will reach grow sustainably.
3. Solve some of our problems while scaling, and in the process find new B2B products to market.
4. Work on other side-projects I had before this one.
5. Spend time building my personal brand and consulting business.
6. Rest for a job that I will join later this month (although the offer is dependant on me getting the visa). 

I would really like to hear the experience from other technical founders on how you converted a successful launch into a 10K/month, ideally, in approximately one year.

Thanks,
